    "# Quant Research Intern Test — Intraday ATM Straddle \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a **Python pipeline** that takes the provided **two months of minute-by-minute options data and spot/index data** (02-01-2025 to 28-02-2025) , **shorts an ATM CE+PE straddle at 10:30 AM** each trading day, manages **combined intraday stop/target**, and produces a **trade sheet and metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this notebook contains an outline of the pipeline with function placeholders. Complete those functions, adhere to the trading rules below, and produce clean outputs. FAQ and definitions appear at the end of this notebook for any doubts about the terminology used below.\n",
    "\n",
    " There are 4 additional csv files attached. **NIFTY_option_data.csv** is the 2 months option data, **NIFTY_spot_data.csv** is the 2 months spot/index data, **SamplePerformanceStats.csv** is a sample output of performance report for reference and **SampleTradeReport.csv** is a sample output for the trading report for your reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A more detailed explanation of what is to be done is explained right before every task. Below is an overview explanation of the task to be implemented.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Trading Rules (Exact Specification)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tSell an ATM straddle at 10:30 am by simultaneously selling both an ATM call option and an ATM put option (**CE_Strike = PE_Strike = ATM_Strike**) with the same weekly expiry date and strike price.\n",
    "2.\tCalculate the 30% stop loss based on the combined premium collected from selling the straddle.\n",
    "3.\tMonitor the position intraday and exit all legs of the trade together if either of the following conditions is met:\n",
    "-\tThe 30% stop loss is triggered.\n",
    "-\tThe target of 80% is achieved (i.e., straddle premium reduces to 20% of entry value).\n",
    "4.\tIf neither condition is met, square off the position at 3:20 pm on the same day (end of intraday session).\n",
    "5.\tGenerate a trade report in the same format as the sample report provided with the assignment. Include details from the sample report and any other relevant information necessary for performance analysis. Trades in the attached report are for reference only, and there is no need to match them.\n",
    "6.\tCalculate returns.\n",
    "7.\tGenerate performance statistics in the same format as the sample performance stats sheet provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Data (What to Load and How)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data horizon\n",
    "- Load the **2 months options data** from the attached options CSV, and the **index (spot) data** CSV.\n",
    "-In this task we will only deal with close prices.\n",

    "#### Definitions (Finance Terms Used)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ATM (At-The-Money):** Option whose **strike** is closest to the current **spot** (index) level.  \n",
    "- **Straddle (Short ATM Straddle):** Strategy of **selling** an ATM **Call (CE)** and an ATM **Put (PE)** with the **same expiry and strike**.  \n",
    "- **CE / PE:** **Call European** and **Put European** options (here simply “call” and “put”).  \n",
    "- **Strike (Strike Price):** The fixed price at which the option can be exercised.  \n",
    "- **Expiry (Expiration Date):** The date on which the option contract expires.  \n",
    "- **Weekly Expiry:** Options that expire weekly (e.g., every Thursday for many index options), as opposed to monthly.  \n",
    "- **Spot (Index Spot):** The real-time (or near real-time) price of the underlying index; used to define ATM.  \n",
    "- **LTP (Last Traded Price):** The most recent trade price of the instrument.  \n",
    "- **OI (Open Interest):** The total number of **outstanding** (open) option contracts.  \n",
    "- **PCR (Put-Call Ratio):** Typically **Put OI / Call OI** (can also be volume-based) — a sentiment indicator.  \n",
    "- **Stop-Loss (SL):** A predefined exit rule to cap loss; here, the **combined straddle value** reaching **+30%** from entry.  \n",
    "- **Target (TP):** A predefined take-profit; here, the **combined straddle value** falling to **20%** of entry (i.e., **80% decay**).  \n",
    "- **Entry_Straddle:** The **sum of CE and PE prices** at the first tick after the entry time (10:30).  \n",
    "- **Intraday:** Trading within the **same trading day**; all positions are closed by session end (3:20 PM here).  \n",
    "- **Lot Size:** The **contract multiplier** (e.g., 15) to convert option price change into cash PnL.  \n",
    "- **Position Sizing:** Deciding **how many lots** to trade based on capital and risk (e.g., `int(20000 / ((CE+PE)*lot))`, cap at 3).  \n",
    "- **PnL (Profit and Loss):** Realized gain or loss; here: `position_size × Total_Returns × lot_size`.  \n",
    "- **Total_Returns (short legs):** Sum of **CE return + PE return**, where each is `(Entry − Exit) / Entry`.  \n",
    "- **Equity Curve:** Plot of **cumulative PnL (or account value)** over time.  \n",
    "- **Drawdown (DD):** Peak-to-trough decline of the equity curve; **Max DD** is the worst such drop.  \n",
    "- **Expectancy:** Average **profit per trade** (in currency or %).  \n",
    "- **Expectancy Ratio:** Expectancy relative to risk or average loss; higher implies better risk-adjusted edge.  \n",
    "- **Profit Factor:** `Total gross profit / Total gross loss`; >1 indicates profitability.  \n",
    "- **Win Ratio (Win Rate):** Percentage of trades with **positive PnL**.  \n",
    "- **High/Low (bar fields):** The maximum/minimum traded price within a time bar (e.g., 1-minute candle).  \n",
    "- **Forward/Backward Fill (ffill/bfill):** Fill small missing values by propagating last known/next known value.\n"
